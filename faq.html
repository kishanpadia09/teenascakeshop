	<div class="faq">
		<br><b>How can I place an order for my wedding cake/hampers/gifts?</b></br>
		<br>Step 1 - get in touch as soon as you know your date</br>
		<br>Step 2 - we plan and design your order that fits with your event size, style and budget</br>
		<br>Step 3 - make your booking fee payment - you will receive an order confirmation</br>
		<br>Step 4 - we will have a final run through over email or by phone where any changes can be made</br>
		<br>Step 5 - delivery of your beautiful bespoke cake!</br>
		<br><hr width="100%"></br>
		<br><b>How much will it cost?</b></br>
		<br>It’s all in the details, all cakes and sweet treats are completely unique, this means there are so many 
		<br>variables to consider when pricing your cake and other wedding goodies. It can depend on 
		<br>shape, size, how many servings, location along with the style, finish and level complexity.<br>(minimum orders do apply)</br>
		<br><hr width="100%"></br>
		<br><b>I have seen a cake online!</b></br>
		<br>That’s great, there are some incredible designs out there and we can certainly use it as our starting point. 
		<br>We love the design process and using it as a reference, making slight adjustments and tweaks to the <br>design will allow it to become more personal to you.</br>	
		<br><hr width="100%"></br>
		<br><b>When should I place an order?</b>
		<br>It really is best to get in touch as soon as you know your event date to check availability, even if you’re not 
		<br>sure of your exact requirements. Some months especially during April-May and December-February have 
		<br>limited availability due to peak season and we do get lots of enquires for last minute orders. We will do our<br> best to fulfil them where possible. </br>
		<br><hr width="100%"></br>
		<br><b>I have no idea what I would like!</b></br>
		<br>Don’t worry, this happens, a lot! From experience we are always able to come up with an initial design that <br>may even evolve into something completely different. I will talk you through all the options and what<br> may seem daunting is actually really fun, honestly!</br>
		<br><hr width="100%"></br>
		<br><b>What size do I need?</b></br>
		<br>This is usually determined by the number of guests you need to cater for and how you would like to serve the<br> cake. Some stay with traditional size portions whilst others would like to serve the cake as dessert. Another<br>consideration is how you would like the cake to be visually. If you only need a small cake but wanted the <br>look of a grander cake, we could introduce false tiers or alter the size and height of the real cake.
		<br></br>Each cake can be altered to fit any size event. For example a three tiered cake would typically be 8 kgs <br>and could cater for 80 guests</br>
		<br><hr width="100%"></br>
		<br><b>Extras</b></br>
		<br>-A variety of pretty cake stands are available to hire when ordering if available. All stands must be <br>returned within two days of hire.
		<br>-Additional items can also be sourced including cake toppers, fresh or silk flowers, cutting knife etc.
